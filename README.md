# A-fully-coupled-numerical-model-of-thermo-hydro-mechanical-processes-and-fracture-contact-mechanics-
Run scripts for the paper A fully coupled numerical model of thermo-hydro-mechanical processes and fracture contact mechanics in porous media by Ivar Stefansson, Inga Berre and Eirik Keilegavlen (all University of Bergen, Norway).

The simulations were performed using version 1.2.0 of PorePy corresponding to commit fa81d41b5ad46e5acd337b74105c61c4d3e9633f, see https://github.com/pmgbergen/porepy/.
